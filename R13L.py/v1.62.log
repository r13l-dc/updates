==== PATCH RELEASE 1.62 ====
> - R13L.py has had some major bug fixes in the new moderation category.
> 1. [🧠] Fixed inconsistent code in `!warn` and `!unwarn`.
> 2. [📝] `!warns` only shows warnings in your current server.

> 4. [ℹ️] Changed the warn ID format to be much more simpler.
> 5. [SPOILER 😳] ||Looking forward to `!ban`, `!unban`, `!mute`, `!unmute` and other commands in the near future!||
> 6. [⛓️‍💥] As always, much more CF feature have been implemented.
