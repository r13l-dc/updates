All R13L and R13L-BOT updates in Markdown

## updates/R13L-BOT

The first R13L (account ID: 1265318721476362343). It was written in [BDFD](https://botdesignerdiscord.com/) (Bot Designer for Discord), meaning it was very buggy and was severly limited due to not being written in an actual programming language. The few features it had were Economy, Fun, Action, Moderation and very limited Welcome messages. It was created and released on 2024 July 23 and soon discontiuned *(switched to a new bot account)* on 2025 May 18th to be replaced with R13L.py.

## updates/R13L.py

The second R13L (account ID: 1366984096139444348). It was written in an actual programming language, being Python, with the help of the `discord.py` library. It was pretty functional and more advanced than R13L-BOT, however it was still not as fancy or as large when compared with R13L. The features of R13L.py are as follows: Economy, Fun, Roleplay, Moderation *(old name)*, Information, Tools and Uncategorised. It was created *(beta/alpha)* on 2025 May 3rd, released on 2025 May 17th, superseded R13L-BOT on 2025 May 18th and then got changed to R13L on 2025 June 5th.

## updates/R13L

The current version of R13L (same account as R13L.py), being the re-branded version of R13L.py with many more united and fancy new features, written in Python (`discord.py`). It is the currently used R13L and is the best by far, with many features and abilities. They are as follows: Moderator, Manager, Economy, Fun, Tools, Images, Roleplay, Information, Welcoming *(Join messages and Leave messages)*, Starboards and extras. It was official when R13L.py re-branded as R13L on 2025 June 5th.
> This was the first R13L to come with a GitHub account, Terms of Service and a Privacy Policy.
