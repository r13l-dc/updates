1. [💼] - Added new jobs! A cook and a scientist are now valid when you get a job.
2. [🌭] - You can now buy food from the market! For now this has no use, but you can buy food by using the **?market** command!
3. [🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿] - Fixed a mispelling and error in grammar when buying Silver Upgrade in the ?shop.
4. [🐞] - Some very basic bug fixes in ?buy aswell.
5. [🏳️‍🌈] - Getting a 50% on ?gay-check will now say "Bisexual" in the footer of it!
6. [🐻] - ?kanye is a new command that gives you a random quote from Ye! The cooldown for this is less than normal aswell.
