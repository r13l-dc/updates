**Hello R13L-BOT users!** Update 1.3 for the R13L-B0T has arrived! We've  worked hard on this update and  spent hours on it! Here's a list of the changes and additions:

1. **?buy became ?shop instead.**
2. **Prices have been made a bit cheaper to buy upgrades.**
3. **Only upgrade roles are needed! Gun owner role and other roles are now useless as the bot uses Variables instead now.**
4. **Changed ?bet to ?gamble.**
5. **Increased chances of winning in gambling.**
6. **Added a way to give all your money using "all" (example: ?pay (mention) all)**
7. **The more levels you have on Arcane bot gives you more money benefits when working.**
8. **Soon an art battle coming...**
9. **Added bug fixes for ?stab and ?shoot.**
