# R13L-BOT UPDATE 2.2 (4/2/25)
Largest update by far! 
1. [😇] REVIVING IS FIXED! Finally, you can revive people who use ?suicide, ?stab, ?shoot and other commands! Probably the bug fix that took the longest even though the fix for it was the easiest ever.
2. [🔏] ?lego has been deleted! CF members are now more present to more privacy and less exposing. This will help in keeping R13L-BOT safe.
3. [💻] The list commands now require to be carbonistical! -lservers and -lusers now cannot be run by the normal user. Only by carbonistical. This will help prevent people who seek into R13L-BOT insides and try to use the information for their own profit.
4. [👊] The ?punch commands is now 20% instead of 25% to prevent spammed usage and to help the R13L-BOT action commands environment. It is still deemed as a fun-action command however due to the low action command similarity and its weaknesses.
5. [🔪] Stabbing finally has a gif! Using ?stab finally now has a gif just like ?shoot and other action commands! Instead of being gifless, it finally has a gif. Use it and see it!
6. [🪢] ?suicide now has a disclaimer when using the command to encourage mentalhealth awareness. Remember, suicide is never the answer. Always reach out to someone! 
7. [🎯] ?hitman command now exists! However, it is only for C~ Federation's owners.
8. [🔨] Usual Big fixes aswell as removing Herobrine.
