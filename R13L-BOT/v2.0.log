# R13L-BOT Update 2.0 (1/31/25 GMT+3)
# The Pet Update!
- Recently, the pet commands have had a ton of issues, so we have decided to fix them and add new additions ontop.
## Changes and additions:
1. [🚶‍♂️🐩] - **?pet walk**! You can finally take your pet on a walk.
2. [💳🐩] - **?pet name has been fixed**. The original '?pet name' couldn't work in the slightest, your pet name was actually infact stuck, but now it has been fixed and uses code different from '?slave name'.
3. [🧸😸] - **?pet play**. Play with your pet.
4. [😢🍃] - **?pet disown** instead of the old ?disown command, this is to keep the pet environment friendly as possible!
5. [🥩🐕] - **?pet feed**. Feed your pet! For now, this is just a single roleplay command which has no extra abilities, but *soon* your pet can get tired and therefore you must feed it.
6. [💡🚫] -  In the R13L-BOT support server, you can report issues and suggestions in <#1280503315888734304> and <#1332761389365989539> .
