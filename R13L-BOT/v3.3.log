@everyone 
## R13L-BOT Update 3.3: (4/27/25 7:15:00 UTC+3)
### This update is mostly all about bug fixing:
1. [🥷] - Fixed the ?rob command cooldown issue.
2. [🤝] - Fixed the whitespace issue in ?give. You don't have to remove the extra space anymore.
3. [🏦] - Fixed the issue with ?deposit which used an " instead of \*.
4. [🥷] - Robbing is now fixed, the chance of robbing is now **33%** instead of **40%**.
5. [🤝] - ?give can also be used as ?give-money, both are valid commands now.
6. [🎲] - Fixed a bug in the ?minigame which made it give an error. This bug was because of some faulty "rock, paper, scissors" from RB 3.1 that was forgotten to be removed. 
7. [🌐] **?short-url** - You can now shorten a URL using R13L-BOT's new command! Simply do "?short-url (website link)" and it will be shortened!
8. [📐] - A misspelling in ?setup has been fixed.
