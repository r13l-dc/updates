### New Stuff:

### Changes:
5. [5️⃣] - Every emoji reactions embed will now be limited to just 5 reactions. 
6. [🔪] - Fixed bugs regarding ?shoot, ?stab and other action commands when it comes to saying the mentioned user isn't a bot.
7. [☠️] - Fixed a bug to make it reset the slaves name after death automatically.
