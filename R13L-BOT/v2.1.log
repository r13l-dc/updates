# R13L-BOT UPDATE 2.1 (2/7/35 GMT+3)
There is nearly, nothing new to the update. But here are a list of changes:
1. [🦟❗] -  Many bug fixes to R13L-BOT including ones with the welcoming and leaving systems in ?setup.
2. [🟢💰] - Rob command had finally been created! It's been ages since this command was first introduced (I've calculated it, **6 months ago**) However the rob command had finally came to life! Simply use ?rob (user) and you'd rob the person.
